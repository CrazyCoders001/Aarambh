## 📌 How to Submit Your Tasks

To keep things clean and consistent, follow these steps:

1. **Create a folder with your name** (e.g., `Akash/`)
2. Inside your name folder, **create a subfolder for each session** using the session date (e.g., `2025-04-14/`)
3. Inside the session folder, add your solutions:
   - `task_1.py`
   - `task_2.py`
   - …and so on!

📁 Folder structure should look like this:

Aarambh/ 
  └── Akash/ 
    ├── 2025-04-14/ 
       ├── task_1.py 
       ├── task_2.py 
    ├── 2025-04-15/ 
       ├── task_1.py 
       ├── task_2.py
